1.  Introduction

   RFC 9000 defines connection migration as a mechanism initiated by the
   client to change its IP address or network path without disrupting
   the QUIC connection.  This mechanism is based on the assumption that
   a client may be behind a NAT and a server has a public address.
   However, there is a reversed situation where a client has a public
   address and a server is behind a NAT.  This document specifies an
   extension that reverses this role: the server initiates migration.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Motivation

   A key scenario is: - The server is initially behind a NAT and cannot
   accept direct connections. - The client has a public IP address. -
   The server first establishes the QUIC connection via a relay server.
   - Immediately after the handshake, the server migrates the connection
   to the client’s public address, reducing latency.

   This specification does not define how the server obtains the public
   address of the client.  Possible methods include application-level
   signaling or external mechanisms, but these are out of scope.

4.  Scope

   *  Reverse migration roles defined in RFC 9000.

   *  Maintain QUIC security guarantees.

   *  No new NAT traversal mechanism.

5.  Negotiating Extension Use

   allow_server_migration (0x3e764478):

   Clients advertise their support of this extension by sending the
   allow_server_migration (0x3e764478) transport parameter (Section 7.4
   of [QUIC-TRANSPORT]) with an empty value.  Sending this transport
   parameter signals to the server that the client will accept the
   server-initiated migration.

   Servers also send this parameter with an empty value.  The server
   informs the client that it will initiate the connection migration by
   sending this parameter.

   When this extension is negotiated, the server-initiated migration is
   only permitted and the client-initiated migration is prohibited.

   An implementation that understands this transport parameter MUST
   treat the receipt of a non-empty value as a connection error of type
   TRANSPORT_PARAMETER_ERROR.

   Endpoints MUST NOT remember the value of this extension for 0-RTT.

6.  Connection Migration Procedure

   The connection migration procedure is the same as (Section 9 of
   [QUIC-TRANSPORT]) except that the roles between the client and the
   server are reversed.

7.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  QUIC Transport Parameter

   This document registers the allow_server_migration transport
   parameter in the "QUIC Transport Parameters" registry established in
   Section 22.3 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].  The following fields are
   registered:

   Value:  0x3e764478

   Parameter Name:  allow_server_migration

   Status:  Provisional

   Specification:  This document

   Change Controller:  IETF (iesg@ietf.org)

Questions

   *  Sould we extend this extension to allow both clients and servers
      to initiate connection migration?

   *  Any new security conserations from allowing servers to initiate
      connection migration?
